title: About OpenHellion
---

OpenHellion was founded in late 2022 in an attempt to reverse-engineer HELLION. The orginal game was developed by the Serbian Zero Gravity Games from 2015 to 2019. Due to a messy development process the game had to close down in 2019 as a result of lacking funds. The game was first made free in a short period, before being taken off Steam forever.

In spite of this, an active community composed of dedicated fans kept the game alive.
Not long after the shutdown, a person started a project to fix all bugs, and in the long term rewrite large chunks of the code. The person chose to organise this in a very autocratic way with closed source and full creative freedom with no way for volunteers to help. This project on the other hand aims to be as open as possible, with the ability for everyone to join if they wish.

We have a [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/OpenHellion/projects/6) for some of the features we want to implement.

In December 2022, Zero Gravity Games was liquidated. This has resulted in uncertainty around the intellectual ownership of the game. This project is non-commercial and voluntary, but if any of the rightholders feel their rights have been infringed, they have a right to have their work removed from the repositories.
