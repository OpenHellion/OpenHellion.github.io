title: About OpenHellion

OpenHellion was founded in autumn 2022 in an attempt to reverse-engineer HELLION back into a fully-functioning Unity project.

The orginal game, HELLION, was developed by the Serbian company Zero Gravity. Development on the game started in 2015, but because of an ineffective development process, the game was shut down in 2019. During the shutdown process, the game was made free in a short period of time, before being taken off Steam completely.

In spite of this, an active community composed of dedicated fans kept the game alive. Not long after the shutdown, a person started a project to fix bugs, and in the long term rewrite and fix unfinished portions of the game. This person chose to organise their project as closed source with little way for volunteers to audit and contribute. OpenHellion realises the potential for a completely open-source alternative to this project, with the ability for everyone to join if they wish.

We have a [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/OpenHellion/projects/4/views/6) for some of the features we wish to implement, and our [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenHellion) is open for anyone to audit and propose changes.

This project differs significantly from the other project in that we've reverse engineered the game back into a functioning Unity project that compiles to an executable that can be downloaded and played without the need to own the game on Steam. This is a significant benefit as the original game is almost impossible to get access to.

In December 2022, Zero Gravity Games was liquidated. This has resulted in uncertainty around the ownership of the intellectual property. This project is non-commercial and voluntary, but if any of the rightholders feel their rights have been infringed, they have a right to have their work removed from the repositories. If you are the current rightholder; please contact me on Discord (makkkkus) or by email (nygardboi (at) protonmail.com).
