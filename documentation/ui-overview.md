![A diagram showing an overview of how the GUI works.](res/UISetup.drawio.svg)

OpenHellion has a slightly complicated GUI setup. We use five different GUIs working in tamdem. Two scenes have one gui each, one has two, in addition to a global gui. WorldScene has two guis because we need one for interactions in the game itself and another for actions that are outside of the scope of the game itself, like a console.
