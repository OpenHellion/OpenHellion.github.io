[OpenHellion](pages/about) is a multiplayer game set in space. You're a part of a mission-gone-wrong to colonise the nearest star. The goal is to survive in space, and to do such you need to follow a series of quests; these will guide you through the core concepts of the game. The game is an open-world sandbox game, and allows you to build and manage your own space stations and ships. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NqhQMfbjxW).

The project is based on the no-longer-available Hellion game, made by the now defunct Serbian company Zero Gravity. It is unclear who the current rightholders of the game are.

The game is still not ready for playing, but we advice you to check out the [source code](https://github.com/OpenHellion), as well as the [about page](pages/about).

Visit the [Hellion Documentation](documentation/home) for a more technical introduction to the game.
